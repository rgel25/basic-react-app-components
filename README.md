## Welcome! üëã

Thanks for checking out this react app!
This is a simple react application wherein I dabble with React.

## The challenge

The main challenge here is applying everything I learned with the basics of React, which is mainly setting up a React app, component usage, and bundling the app together with SASS.

## My solution

I created two components named Nav and Main. I then used an App component to enclosed these smaller components. I was also able to bundle SASS successfully by importing the CSS output of SASS in the App component. Lastly, I learned a new pseudo element for list items to add style to its marker. - _li::marker_

## Technologies used
